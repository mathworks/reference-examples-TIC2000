This repository will host Simulink reference application examples using  Embedded Coder TI C2000 Support Package. The following examples are provided:

1. Interface BiSS-C Absolute Encoder using the TI Position Manager board from Simulink for F28379D Launchpad.

2. CAN Multiple ID Transmit Receive Support using Embedded Coder TI C2000 Support Package for F28379D Launchpad and F280049C Launchpad.

3. FLASH EEPROM Emulation from Simulink using Embedded Coder TI C2000 Support Package for F28379D Launchpad.
		
	3.a New updates to ensure Flash sector for calibration is erased only after 'm' Banks each having 'n' Pages are updated with the calibration data.
       'm' and 'n' can be defined to any length of the Flash sector. The current page holds the last updated calibration data.
